# EC327_project

Current Goal:
 - Create an interface where the user can type two labeled directories in their computer that store many images
 - Write a program that takes in those files, and uses machine learning to visualize the average of the two datasets.
    This requires using matplotlib or some other graphing library that can store the graphs into a picture in the file.
 - Once the program running matplotlib outputs the files, they are shown in the front-end.
 
 If we have time:
 - Implement a menu so the user can choose which type of machine learning they want
 - Implement a feature that can compare a self uinputted image with the trained model
